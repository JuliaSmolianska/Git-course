    <p>Espresso Sosta Bar is a tiny coffee bar that attracts espresso enthusiasts, who order their favourite hot drink from the smartlydressed baristas behind the counter full of Italian panini, cannoli and biscotti. Here you drink your coffee (well, espresso really) quickly and straight up. The whole procedure takes just a few minutes.</p>
